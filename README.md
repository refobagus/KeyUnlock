# KeyUnlock

Account information keeping app for IOS
Final Project for CptS 479 - Mobile App Development at Washington State University

KeyUnlock is an IOS password keeper app targeted to older, less tech savvy people to use.
This app focuses on the user experience rather than the technology itself.
As of now, the password is static since I have no idea where to put a settings button to change password.
The password is r4mpage
It is highly unlikely I will update this app, unless I bought my own apple product since this was made from an Apple laptop that I borrow from someone.
It is also highly unlikely that I will buy my own apple product.

Hey at least I got an A on this class overall.
